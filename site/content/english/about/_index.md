The [RAM role](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/research-infrastructure-roles/ram.html) was pioneered at the Turing in order to **fill the gap** between academic knowledge generation and practical tool creation.
RAMs collaborate with research teams to make their research output **more relevant** for a broad audience within and beyond the scope of the original research field.
By focusing on the **user perspective**, RAMs increase the **sustainability** and the **impact** of research outputs.

Are you a researcher interested in amplifying the impact of your work? Engage with the RAM team at any stage of your project, but the earlier, the better. We'll integrate impact into your project plan from the start. Check out our impact matrix below to see if your project could benefit from working with a RAM.
