The aim of the interviews is two-fold:

- To help us flesh out a framework for prioritising projects RAMs can work with
- To gain a wider understanding of Turing research projects and their approaches to key questions (impact, values, governance etc.)

The end-to-end process for carrying out interviews is:

- [Identify project teams to interview](#identify-project-teams-to-interview)
- [Schedule the interview](#schedule-the-interview)
- [Carry out the interview](#carry-out-the-interview)
- [Store the notes on this repo](#store-the-notes-on-this-repo)
- [Analyse the notes](#analyse-the-notes)
- [Carry out follow on actions](#carry-out-follow-on-actions)

## Identify project teams to interview

The interviews, when taken all together, should provide a broadly representative view of the current research landscape at the Turing Institute.

Check the [interview notes](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-application-management/blob/main/docs/project_ram/interviews/interview_notes.md) document to see which projects have already been interviewed - and don't interview them again!

We should also be prioritising projects that:

- Come from programmes we currently have not interviewed
- Are doing very different work from projects we have already interviewed
- Are both involved and not involved with RAMs and TPS already

Whilst it could be useful to also interview people about projects that have now finished, that is beyond the scope of these interviews

## Schedule the interview

1 RAM should be enough to carry out each interview - however feel free to team up with more than one RAM if you think it would be helpful!

We recommend minimum 30 minutes per interview.
Whilst longer conversations can be scheduled, it would be better to ensure an interview takes place for 30 minutes than to risk missing an interview because the interviewee can't dedicate any more time

## Carry out the interview

Use the [interview template](./2023-08-14-interview-template.md) to structure your conversation.

These interviews are [semi-structured](https://delvetool.com/blog/semi-structured), meaning they don't have to follow verbatim the template - make a copy of the template and tweak it as you see fit for your interview, and don't worry about hitting all the questions if you don't have time!
Just be sure to make a record of where you got to, and how the format/structure can be changed to maximise the usefulness of the interviews going forwards.

All the content from the interivew should be captured in written notes.
Check with the interviewee they are happy for you to take notes throughout the session.
If they are also happy to be recorded, you may want to do this to help you with writing up notes afterwards.
Ensure you check with the interviewee first, and make clear how the recording will be used (just by the RAM to transcribe any notes you missed during the session, and then they will be deleted)

Also check whether the interviewee is happy for their anonymised notes to be made open, and record their response.

## Store the notes on this repo

Ensure that any link to notes you share in the [interview notes doc](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-application-management/blob/main/docs/project_ram/interviews/interview_notes.md) is only accessible to the RAM team.

Any public/open version of the notes must be stripped of all identifiers before being made open.

## Analyse the notes

The analysis process for the notes should be undertaken by two RAMs.

The RAMs should independently carry out [thematic analysis](https://delvetool.com/blog/thematicanalysis) on the interview.
They should then come together to compare their analysis, before combining their work into one comprehensive analysis of the interview.
A link to this analysis should be made available alongside the interview notes in the [interview notes file](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-application-management/blob/main/docs/project_ram/interviews/interview_notes.md)

## Carry out follow on actions

The process of analysing the interviews will likely surface some ideas on how to improve/adapt the RAM framework and interview templates.
Use the `Project RAM` issue template to start a discussion on these changes!
