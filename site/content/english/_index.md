    content: "Effective research has the potential to do more than answer a specific research question. The RAM skillset is focused on effectively exploring and answering questions like:"
    bulletpoints:
      - "Who might use this research when it is completed, and how might they benefit from it?"
      - "Who will be affected by the research, and what outcomes would they like to see?"
      - "Does the research project consider sustainability beyond a specific funding window?"
      - "How does the work fit into the wider landscape of research in my field and other fields?"

    content: "In our RAM impact matrix, we consider multiple dimensions of a research project and team to prioritise engagement across Turing's research projects:"
    bulletpoints:
      - "Applicability: How much potential does the research project have for real-world use?"
      - "Capability: To what extent does the team have the skills to translate their research to real-world use?"
      - "Values: How much does the team's approach to research align with our focus areas within the Tools, Practices, and Systems (TPS) programme? (e.g. interoperable open source tools, interdisciplinary collaboration, participatory co-creation)"
      - "Practices: How ready is the team to adopt RAM ways of working?"
