Dr Kalle Westerling is a Research Application Manager at the Turing Research and Innovation Cluster in Digital Twins (TRIC: DT). He works with the TRIC: DT team of scholars to aid them in providing open and reproducible computational and social tools that are accessible to the UK research and innovation communities, keeping the user perspective prioritised in the development of research software, and to ensure the longevity, sustainability, and collaborative open-source advancement of these vital tools.

Prior to joining the Alan Turing Institute, Kalle was a Research Software Engineer with the Living with Machines collaboration between the British Library, the Alan Turing Institute, and researchers from a range of UK universities. In that role, he developed new digital research methods, tools and ways of working with historical collections at scale.

Kalle holds a PhD in Theatre and Performance Studies from The Graduate Center, City University of New York (CUNY), where he visualised and analysed networks of marginalised, itinerant nightlife performers in the 1930s. In the United States, Kalle managed the Scholars program at HASTAC and the Digital Humanities Research Institute at CUNY, both efforts across numerous higher education institutions, aiming to build nation-wide infrastructures and communities for digital humanities skill-building.
