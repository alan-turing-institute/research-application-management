Sophie is a Research Application Manager at the Turing Research and Innovation Cluster in Digital Twins (TRIC:DT). As part of the Innovation and Impact Hub, she will work towards open and reproducible computational and social tools around digital twin technology across a range of sectors.

Sophie’s background is in cognitive neuroscience. She holds a PhD from the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, where she applied machine learning techniques to neuroimaging data to study the neurobiology of language. Prior to joining the Alan Turing Institute, she held a position as Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Oxford, studying the learning mechanisms of both humans and artificial neural networks.

Next to her research, Sophie also worked as a Data Scientist at the mobile tech start-up Skin Bliss, where she helped integrating AI and dermatology research to enhance the company’s recommendation engine and is still supporting the team in developing an educational video curriculum.
