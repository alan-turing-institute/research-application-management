Aida is a Senior Researcher in the Tools, Practices and Systems Programme. She is leading on Research Applications at The Alan Turing Institute. Her focus is making sure that research outputs are not just openly available but that they meet stakeholder needs. Aida is leading a growing team of Research Application Managers (RAMs) whose goal is to increase the reach and maximise the positive impact of research outputs. The role of a RAM has been inspired by that of a product manager in a tech firm, but adapted for research purposes.

She recieved her BA in Mathematics from Cambridge and her PhD in Theoretical Physics from UCL. Her research into the physics of tumour formation was published in Nature and she won a Bronze Medal at the International Physics Olympiad. After her PhD, she worked in industry for six years, most recently as a Principal in a data science consultancy.
