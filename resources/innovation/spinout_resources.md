# Spinout Resources

## Incubator programmes
A good way to find support and connect with relevant people and organzations is to join an incubator programme such as Google's [Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com), [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/), or Code for Science and Society's [Incubator](https://www.codeforsociety.org/incubator/).
These are only three examples out of many programmes, and you may find that a domain or field-specific programme is more aligned with your needs and values, so it's worth doing some research and speaking to your peers to find the best fit.
Participating in an incubator programme has several advantages including growing your network and community through dedicated mentorship and support; however, these programmes are not the only means of connecting with others in your field.
Once you have identified the areas of your project that require support, you can reach out to your colleagues and collaborators to discuss options for sustaining your project.

## Connecting with the wider ecosystem
Often, research projects coming out of academia might have an active contributor base but don't have access to the computing infrastructure and support resources required to maintain the project in the long term.
In that case, you may want to consider embedding the project into a larger pre-existing open source project or product.
By exploring connections within your community, whether through an incubator program or your existing network, you may find organizations that are interested in incorporating your work into an existing, stable infrastructure.

If you are looking to build a community and find users and contributors, you can contribute your work to an ecosystem that hosts and supports code for related applications. 
One example is [Scientific Python](https://scientific-python.org), which provides a platform where you can make your code widely available to a broad audience and invite contributors from an established community.

## Raising funding
If you think your project is ready to be spun out into an independent enterprise, there is a wide range of possibilities for funding and supporting a non-profit or commercial organization based around open source software.
Some projects turn to their communities to raise funds through donations or crowdsourcing campaigns.
Others may look to government grants or other grand funding from philanthropic organisations such as the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/hosting) or [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/).
Finally, if your project generates revenue, you may consider raising funding from a private investor or company, or join a funded startup incubator programme such as [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/).
