# Dataset
Tom Andersson, a research engineer at DeepMind, said the new model had been schooled on data sets that recorded the life cycles of nearly 5,000 hurricanes over the past 45 years. The data libraries included those of the National Hurricane Center as well as the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, a science cooperative for dozens of countries.

# Discussion
- Difference between Deepmind and Google Research
    - GraphCast: Google Research
    - GenCast: Google Deepmind
- WeatherLab developing and integration: Dr. Hogsett said the new accord is structured in what’s known as a cooperative research and development agreement, or CRADA. Originally, CRADAs let Washington spin off federal technologies for industry use. But increasingly, the agreements give the government a window into private-sector innovations.

- Building sandbox environments like Google have done with WeatherLab is quite nice
    - invites exploration (through historic cyclones)
    - It allows for benchmarking with other weather models
- Notably, they did not yet release weights of pretrained model. Also, although they work with NOAA NHC, they do not compare explicitly against NOAAs HAFS model (though mention in blogpost that they outperform on intensity)
- Comparison of WeatherLab vs ECWMF visualisation tool
    - [ECWMF](https://charts.ecmwf.int/products/medium-tc-genesis?base_time=202506301200&layer_name=genesis_td&projection=opencharts_wnp&valid_time=202507081200)
        - Looks modern, not outdated
        - Combines a lot of different metrics that fall out of the AI model (realism)
        - Download data easily from same interface
        - WeatherLab aimed at prospective user (focus on benchmarking), ECMWF charts aimed at expert user (focus on extracting specific information efficiently)
