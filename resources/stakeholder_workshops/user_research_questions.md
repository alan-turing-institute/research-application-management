# Process & Guidance for Designing Effective User Research Questions

## Pre-work before drafting usability questions

- With team, specify features of MVP
- With team, specify Experiment / Hypotheses around current MVP
- With team draft user journeys
- Identify gaps in understanding of user journey

## Decide

- Do you need to ask **quantitative** or qualitative **questions**?
- Do you need to **screen** participants or are they **pre-identified**, if so based on what criteria?
- What format will these questions be answered, **1:1 interview**, **group brainstorm** or **async questionnaire**?

## How to structure questioning

- **Pre-test** question to evaluate user's experience level / user profile. 
- **Warm-up** question to put the user into the mood or context of the user experience
- **Test** questions goal is to collect data that explains why users make certain choices while they complete tasks.

## Types of questions

**James P. Spradley,** The ethnographic interview
### Descriptive questions
- **Purpose:** To gather a broad understanding of the participant's experiences and environment.
- **Examples:** "Can you describe a typical day at your job?" or "What do you usually do on weekends?"
- **Types:**
	- **Grand Tour Questions:** Broad questions asking for a general description (e.g., "Can you describe your neighborhood?")
	- **Mini-Tour Questions:** Focus on a specific event or activity (e.g., "Can you describe how you prepare for a meeting?")
	- **Example Questions:** Asking for specific examples to clarify general statements (e.g., "Can you give an example of a typical family gathering?")
	- **Experience Questions:** Probing past experiences (e.g., "Can you tell me about a time when you felt particularly proud of your work?")
### **Structural Questions**
- **Purpose:** To access the organization of one’s knowledge including the categories and mental models employed during an interaction event. 
- **Examples:** "What are the different types of meetings you attend?" or "What categories of music do you listen to?"
- **Types:**
    - **Domain Questions:** Identify larger categories or domains within which the participant's knowledge is organized (e.g., "What are the different roles in your company?")
    - **Cover Term Questions:** Elicit broad categories and the terms participants use to describe them (e.g., "What are all the terms you use to describe a good meal?")
    - **Included Term Questions:** Drill down into specific elements within a domain (e.g., "What are the different dishes you consider 'comfort food'?")
### **Contrast Questions**

- **Purpose:** To uncover distinctions and differences within different user experiences
- **Examples:** "How is a 'team meeting' different from a 'department meeting'?" or "What is the difference between a good teacher and a great teacher?"
- **Types:**
    - **Contrast Set Questions:** Ask participants to distinguish between items within a set (e.g., "What’s the difference between a casual and a formal dinner?")
    - **Dyadic Contrast Questions:** Compare two elements directly (e.g., "How does a birthday party differ from a holiday celebration?")
    - **Triadic Contrast Questions:** Involve comparing three items to highlight differences (e.g., "Among these three brands of phones, which two are most alike and why?")
### **Evaluative Questions**

- **Purpose:** To understand participants' values, preferences, and judgments.
- **Examples:** "What makes a restaurant a good place to eat?" or "How do you decide what news sources to trust?"
