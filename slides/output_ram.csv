AB Street,"An open source urban modelling platform that invites users to add different street interventions to view the impact on traffic in the surrounding neighbourhood and city at large. A/B street can help residents and planners have a shared canvas for discussing potential street-level changes, such as planting street trees or installing a model filter to encourage cycling and walking.",Stakeholder engagement,We worked with local councils to use the tool in public consultation and co-creation session.,https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/software/ltn/index.html,https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/street-smart-putting-neighbourhood-design-hands-bristol-residents,,,Y,,,,
