# Team strategy documentation

## Introduction

The RAM team has developed some template documents, guidance and resources for running team strategy sessions.
An overview of these sessions can also be found in [the Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/stakeholder-engagement.html#strategy-alignment-workshops).

This folder is a comprehensive collection of everything required to get started planning your own sessions, including:

* [**Facilitator notes**](./facilitator_notes.md): Guidance on how to run each session
* [**Miro notes**](./miro_notes.md): Guides on how to use our [Miro template](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMD7H9-Q=/)
* [**Resources**](./resources.md): Links to all useful resources, including Miro, HackMD, presentations and more

## Overview
### Aims

The aim of this session is to align a project under a shared team strategy.
The output from these sessions should be a clear understanding of the team's vision, core focus areas (or 'pillars') and the work that needs to be done to achieve this vision. 
This could be in the form of a presentation, one pager, paper, blog post or something else.
For the templates, we are using a presentation.

In order for these sessions to be successful, it is important to focus on two main areas:
1. **Individual empowerment**: Providing the spaces, structures and opportunities for team members to share their, and understand others, core motivations and visions for the project.
2. **Team alignment**: Carving a path forward for the team that encompasses the core aims and desires of all team members.

A team strategy can only be successfully implemented if there is buy-in across the team. 
Focusing on these two areas will ensure you run sessions that maximise the chance of a successful strategy being formed.

### Design

This RAM exercise is infomred by Simon Sinek's [Golden Circle method](https://www.smartinsights.com/digital-marketing-strategy/online-value-proposition/start-with-why-creating-a-value-proposition-with-the-golden-circle-model/), where the team approaches their work in the following order:
* **Why**: Why are we doing what we're doing? 
    * This is the ultimate 'North Star' or 'vision' of the project - the fundamental, emotive reason the work is being done
* **How**: How do we achieve our mission? 
    * This question concerns the broad focus areas, or 'pillars' that setup up the project to achieve the vision
* **What**: What do we actually do?
    * This question takes the why and the how, and identifies key activities teams can undertake to achieve their goals

We think it is important to take these in order and identify work from the bottom up, rather than guessing at important work and assigning it top-down.

#### Why
This should be the most uncontroversial part of defining a team strategy. 
A team should be able to align themselves under a shared vision practicable and realisable in the real-world - if they can't achieve this they will not easily be able to determine what work is important to the project's aims and what isn't.
It is worth having an entire session on the why, to ensure everyone is aligned. 
This will ensure the team has strong foundations to fall back on when answering more difficult questions in future sessions.

Additionally, it can be helpful to distinguish between a team vision vs. a mission:
- Vision is the emotive, long-term aspirations for the project, and the fundamental reason why the project exists 
- Mission is  how to get there, a soft and broad pathway towards the vision

It is likely this session will contain discussions around both the vision and the mission, which can be incorporated together into a guiding 'North Star' for the project.

##### Intended output
* One sentence (or very short) vision and mission

#### How
This is the crucial step for turning the shared vision into clear pathways forward.
It should include frank discussions on what work matters, what doesn't, and what feeds into the vision. 
This is likely to build upon themes/discussion points that arose in the 'Why' section.

The aim fo the 'How' section is to determine the broad 'pillars' of the project - the areas of work the project team will focus on to help achieve their 'North Star'. 
The identification of more concrete work and activities within these pillars is part of the 'Why' Section.

Whilst the 'why' is a sentence, the 'how' should be a visualiation or similarly simple presentation highlighting the key focus areas of a project, and how they relate to each other.
For instance, are pillars connected in a hierarchy, stemming from one key focus area? Are they independedent (like a spider diagram) or are they all interconnected (like a Venn diagram).

Once these pillars have been identified and agreed upon by the project team, the next part of this section is to identify 'measures of success' for each pillar.
These are similar to 'Key Performance Indicators' (KPIs) - measures that allow the team to understand how well they are doing in each pillar.

> :bulb: **RAM insight**: Especially in the research context, these measures do not have to be defined numerically (as KPIs often are). For instance, a 'measure of success' might be 'open communication spaces, which might not be best represented by 'number of new issues on GitHub' (are issues the best way to measure engagement) or 'number of users on Slack (are they contributing to discussions). If you can land on a numerical, definable measure, great! But be careful of [vanity metrics](https://review.firstround.com/im-sorry-but-those-are-vanity-metrics), and understand it is ok to not yet know how to best present your measure of success.

These success measures will be crucial in helping identify activities the team should undertake. 
They should be categorised under one of the pillars - if there isn't one they belong under, is it the right measure for the project? Or if it is, do you have the right pillars?

##### Intended output
* Visualiation/outline of 'pillars' that highlight key focus areas and their relationships
* Clear 'measures of success' for each pillar

#### What
This activity will tie together previous discussions and lead to the identification of key activities for the project team to undertake.
This is likely to be the most difficult of the three sections, as it requires relatively brutal prioritisation of work, allocating responsibilities and deciding ways of working.

If done successfully, by the end of this session the team should be clear on what work needs to be done, how it fits into their identified pillars, and how it moves the project team towards their ultimate vision.

This is also likely to be the most dynamic/flexible of the sections - whilst we recommend regular (for instance, quarterly) review of the full team strategy, it is crucial to regularly review the activities being undertaken and whether they are still right. 
This is especially important as certain activities will reveal new knowledge/insights that may reshape project priorities.

Once activities have been identified and allocated amongst the team, it is important to set aside time to agree upon ways of working. 
This is very context dependent, and the granularity of this conversation can be tweaked based on the working patterns of the project team.
Discussions to include here are what project management methodology (if any) the team will use (e.g. agile, scrum or something else), what meetings the team will have, where resources and documentation will be stored and shared, and more.

##### Intended outputs
* Core project activities, and an understanding of how difficult they will be to action. These should be definable activities that can easily be marked as 'in progress' or 'completed' (for instance, 'greater engagement' would not be a good activity (hard to mark as completed), but 'establish a schedule of fortnightly community calls' would be better)
* Responsibility mapping of activities - which activites sit with which team, and expected time/resource required to action them
* Ways of working - identifying the patterns of working that will allow the team to efficiently and effectively action all established activities.

## RAM templates

The RAM team are dynamically and iteratively building a set of templates for sessions using these design principles to reproduce, use, and contribute improvements to.
If you wish to dive into these templates, check out:
* [Facilitator notes](./facilitator_notes.md) - an in-depth guide to running sessions, including lessons learned and RAM insights
* [Miro notes](./miro_notes.md) - documentation on how to use the [template Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMD7H9-Q=/)
