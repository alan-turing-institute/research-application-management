# Team Strategy Workshop 

This RAM exercise is infomred by Simon Sinek's [Golden Circle method](https://www.smartinsights.com/digital-marketing-strategy/online-value-proposition/start-with-why-creating-a-value-proposition-with-the-golden-circle-model/), where the team approaches their work in the following order:
* Why: Why are we doing what we're doing? 
    * This is the ultimate 'North Star' or 'vision' of the project - the fundamental, emotive reason the work is being done
* How: How do we achieve our mission? 
    * This question concerns the broad focus areas, or 'pillars' that setup up the project to achieve the vision
* What: What do we actually do?
    * This question takes the why and the how, and identifies key activities that teams can undertake to achieve their goals

We think it is important to take these in order and build the work to be done from the bottom up, rather than guessing at it's importance and assigning it top-down.
The following sections will cover the RAM team's notes on our approach to facilitating conversations around each section - Why? How? and What?

## Why
This should be the most uncontroversial part of defining a team strategy. A team should be able to align themselves under a shared vision of real-wolrd impact - if they can't achieve this they will not easily be able to determine what work is important to the project's aims and what isn't.
It is worth having an entire session on the why, to ensure everyone is aligned. Additionally, it can be helpful to distinguish between a team vision vs. a mission:
    * Vision is emotive
    * Mission is how to get there

### Activity
We think for this session it is helpful to keep the conversation open-ended, but also give the option to follow a template or structure if they prefer, for example an output can be:
- The [project name] project exists to [why do we exist]. It achieves this because it is a [what is it?] that [what problem does it solve?] by [what does it do?] for [who is it for] who [why do these people use it?]

### Intended output
* One sentence vision and mission

## How
This is mean to be an open, frank conversation about the team's core values, vision and mission. I
tshould include a discussion on what work matters, what doesn't, and what feeds into the vision. 
Whilst specific work won't be part of the final team vision, the facilitator should keenly note what topics arise during this discussion, to utilise as a starting point for the 'How' session.

Whilst the 'why' is a sentence, the 'how' should be a visualiation highlighting the key focus areas, and how they relate to each other, e.g.:
* Hierarchical
* Interconnected
* Spider

### Activity
Prior to the session, the facilitators should create their own version of this, based on their knowledge from the previous session, which can be used for reference.
Participants should get the chance to do this exercise themselves, then refer to this pre-created version to help shape and finalise their designs.

### Intended output
* Visualiation of key 'pillars' that highlight key focus areas and their relationships

## What
This activity will tie together previous discussions and lead to the creation of the following outputs:
* Measures of success
* Core activities
* Resposibility areas
* Roadmap

## Best practices for each session
* [1-2-4-All](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/) format for group discussions 
* Prioritise discussions taking the time they need
* Invest time in facilitation, synthesizing and review, to capture and reflect progress made each session
* Avoid revisiting conversations after consensus is achieved, so that the team can move on and fully focus on the next topic
