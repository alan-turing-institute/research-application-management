# Stakeholder Workshop Checklist
This checklist is meant to support the design and delivery of stakeholder workshops.
As a RAM, you will likely be working with other teams on the workshop, who may have other objectives. This checklist shouldn't be seen as a comprehensive list of all possible tasks or all mandatory tasks. It is meant to support the planning and task distribution amongst members of the workshop organising team.

## Pre-workshop
_Depending on how big the project team is, ask who will be supporting this workshop and communicate roles & responsibilities for any of the following task categories:_

### Stakeholder Engagement (Core RAM task)

* Identify a group of participants (e.g., stakeholder mapping)
* Obtain specific contact details
* Are stakeholders being engaged for the first time?
    * If yes convene an introductory session prior to the main workshop
* Choose appropriate group or breakout activities for the workshop
* Be clear in how output will be captured from the participants (e.g., scribes, video/audio recordings, etc)

### Workshop Planning and Execution (Coordination / RAM tasks)

* Create workshop briefing and circulate with wider project team
    * Clear summary of the workshop aims, including definition of audience, list of expected outcomes, explicit value proposition for all invited stakeholders.
    * Timed agenda for the day, including names of session facilitators
* Planning the workshop execution and post-workshops stages in line with the purpose, objectives and outcomes
* Having contingency plans for identified risks (e.g., limited acceptances from participants) 

### Communications

* Sending formal invitations with all neccessary information (e.g., background, purpose, obtaining consent, ethical considerations, location, etc) 
* Capturing all neccessary participant data in line with legal requirements (e.g., personal details, dietary requirements, etc) 
    * Different info and data may be required by different project parties (eg. funders, turing, gdpr requirements) -> Coordinate with PMU to know what is suitable for your project.

### Logistics

* Consider a location which is appropriate for all participants to be included taking into account any special requirements 
* Consider hybrid options for all inclusive participation. Is the set-up required for hybrid in place?
* Have all digital tools and hardcopy resources ready with contingency plans in-place especially for technology failures.

## During workshop

* Setup equipment at the location according to the plan for the day (e.g., seating)
* Test all technology and take stock of required resources prior to arrival of participants 
* Register attendees as they arrive and disseminate any resources (e.g., documentation, name badges, etc)
* Where possible, actively engage all participants with opportunities to provide input, especially those who appear to be reluctant to engage
* As the organiser, exercise a disciplined approach that adheres to the time-scales assigned to activities ensuring regular breaks
* Consider the following activities as part of the workshop format:
    * Welcome & Introductions
    * Setting the scene, background, aims & objectives and logistics for the day
    * Presentation of pre-requisite knowledge through an appropriate format prior to engaging participants
    * Plenaries at the end of each session
    * Dedicated session for next steps
    * Final remarks from the organisers

## Post-workshop

* Send a follow up survey requesting feedback
* Where possible, forward resources used on the day
* Once outcomes have been realised communicate these
