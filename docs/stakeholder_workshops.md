# Stakeholder Workshop Checklist

**Pre-workshop:** At this stage all activities that need to happen before the workshop should be completed.
* Identifying a group of participants (e.g., stakeholder mapping)
* Obtaining specific contact details
* Sending formal invitations with all neccessary information (e.g., background, purpose, obtaining consent, ethical considerations, location, etc) 
* Capturing all neccessary participant data in line with legal requirements (e.g., personal details, dietary requirements, etc)
* Planning the workshop execution and post-workshops stages in line with the purpose, objectives and outcomes
* Having contingency plans for identified risks (e.g., limited acceptances from participants) 
* Consider a location which is appropriate for all participants to be included taking into account any special requirements 
* Consider hybrid options for all inclusive participation
* Have all digital tools and hardcopy resources ready with contingency plans in-place especially for technology failures
* Be clear in how output will be captured from the participants (e.g., scribes, video/audio recordings, etc)

**Workshop execution**

* Test all technology and take stock of required resources prior to arrival of participants 
* Register attendees as they arrive and disseminate any resources (e.g., documentation, name badges, etc)
