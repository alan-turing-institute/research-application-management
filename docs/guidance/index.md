# 📚 Guidance

The aim of this folder is to share best-practice in RAM focus areas that projects at Turing (and beyond!) can peruse and utilise as they see fit.

Please feel free to update/adapt/change anything within these files as new learning take place ⭐️

## 🪜 Steps to create new guidance

1. Create a new subfolder in the guidance folder with the title of your focus are, e.g. 'user-testing' or 'stakeholder-maps'

2. Create two new files, `summary.md` and `turing_examples.md`

3. Copy in the [template structure](./template.md) for each file.

4. Add your content! 🚀
