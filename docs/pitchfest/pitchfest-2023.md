# PitchFest 2023

This page contains a write-up of all the steps that made up PitchFest 2023, run by the Alan Turing Institute at AI UK 2023.

Please feel free to use this as a guide to set up and run your own PitchFest! 
However, please don't take the below as a rigid script - this was our first year running it and we learned a lot to improve for future years.
This is highlighted by a 'potential improvements' heading under each section below.

## Overview
PitchFest broadly consisted of the following steps, which will be broken down below:
- [Preparation](#preparation)
- [Call for applications](#call-for-applications)
- [Closing applications and judging process](#closing-applications-and-judging-process)
- [Finalist training](#finalist-training)
- [Finalist training session](#finalist-training-session)
- [PitchFest event at AIUK](#pitchfest-event-at-aiuk)
- [Wrapping up and next steps](#wrapping-up-and-next-steps)

### Preparation
#### Summary

The first step was to scope out what PitchFest looks like. 
This included considerations for:
- The application process
- The judging criteria
- The event timeline
- The judges
- The prizes

The end output for this stage was the creation of a [PitchFest one pager](https://www.turing.ac.uk/pitchfest-share-your-research-world) to which all applications were directed.

##### Application process
Applicants needed to submit their application via Google Form that contained:
- Their name (required)
- Their Turing role or affiliation (required, only Turing people could apply for PitchFest 2023)
- Pitch title (required)
- Association with a Turing research project (optional)
- Other people involved with the pitch (optional)
- Pitch (required, submission either via text or link to a video or audio recording)
- Any other information (optional)

##### Judging criteria
The judging criteria were determined by the RAM team, and were:
- **Accessibility and communication**: The audience at AI UK is broad with a diverse range of attendees coming from various backgrounds. Is the pitch appropriate for the audience while also being as inclusive and accessible as possible? 
- **Real-world application**: As the national institute for data science and AI, itâ€™s crucial to ensure our research outputs are being applied to solve real-world problems. Does the pitch clearly lay out the motivations for the work and identify real-world applications? 
- **Future directions**: The Turing seeks to build open source infrastructure that is accessible to all. Does the project reflect the principles of openness, reproducibility, and co-creation that ensure a sustainable and meaningful research output? 

##### The event timeline
This was decided by working back from AIUK, to determine how much time we needed for each step. The final timeline was:
- **January 23**: Call for pitches open
- **February 17**: Submissions close
- **February 24**: Finalists notified
- **February 27 / March 6**: Training sessions for finalists
- **March 14**: Rehearsal in Enigma

##### Judges
Sourcing the judges was undertaken by the events nad parternships team, leveraging Turing's pre-existing network.
Suitaible judges were identified who:
- Represented different sectors (academia, private, public)
- Were senior in their respective industries

It was important to source an initial list of judges to include in the one pager.
Further work was done with these judges as the event went on (see below)

##### Prizes
An intiail list of prizes was identified for the winner. As there was no budget for this year's PitchFest, the prize list was focus on skill development, and spotlighting in Turing comms.

Prizes included:
- Public comms (including an announcement and blog post) on your research project
- A mentoring session with the RAM team exploring impact & engagement
- A Turing swag bag
- The glory of winning the first-ever Turing PitchFest!

Eventually a Turing bust was created as the trophy for the winner, which went down really well, this should be included in the future!

The focus of PitchFest should be friendly competition, and the chance to learn how to pitch your work to a broad audience - for all those who take part.
We therefore feel it important to not make the prize too large/swanky, as it may end up promoting the wrong message.

#### Tasks
- [ ] Create a one pager/application form that contains all relevant information, which included the following tasks:
    - [ ] Finalise and communicate the application process
    - [ ] Create an application form
    - [ ] Decide upon judging criteria
    - [ ] Decide event timeline
    - [ ] Identify and confirm initial list of judges
    - [ ] Identify and confirm prizes for winner


#### Potential improvements
##### Application process
- This could possibly be opened up to people outside the Turing in the future
- We ended up only having one person present per pitch - this should be made clear at the application stage
- Creating an FAQs to live on the one pager from common questions we had would be beneficial
- Text pithces didn't work. Video or audio submission should be mandatory.

##### Judging criteria

##### Event timeline
- Everything felt a bit rushed and last minute. Whilst the application window was long enough, there could have been more time for finalist training, the rehearsal in Enigma and the main event. More details below.

##### Judges
- The judges list ebbed and flowed as people became more or less available, beyond the initial application window. Confirming and cementing judges ahead of time would be preferable.

##### Prizes
- With some more funding and preparation time better prizes could be offered, e.g. networking or skill development opportunities. However these should not be so large as to create too intense a competition, or risk excluding non-winners from good development opportunities.
- We may also want to consider layered prizes, e.g. opportunities for those who apply, the finalists and the winner.

### Call for applications
You can see [our collection of comms templates here](./comms-templates.md)

#### Summary
This part of the process was mainly focused on Outreach to possible applicants.

PitchFest 2023 was open to anybody with a Turing affiliation, including any researchers working on a Turing project, Turing Fellows, and Enrichments Students. 
Researchers could apply either individually or as a project team.

The main outreach focused on:
- Posting in relevant Turing Slack channels
- Asking PMU to forward the opportunity on 
- Hosting Office hours for anyone that had questions
- Individual reachout to enrichment students via Slack

We had a range of people apply, but decided to focus upon enrichment students specifically, as we felt they would be most receptive to the opportunity.
Nevertheless, we had applications (17 in total) from both enrichment students and Turing researchers.

All people that applied would probably be classified as early career researchers.
This is what we expected, and may influence who you choose to reach out to!

##### Slack channel posting
We had some general comms options that we shared in key Slack channels.

You can see templates [here](./comms-templates.md). 
This may feel a little bit spam-y - remember that this is a cool opportunity that people should know about!

##### PMU outreach
This was a more strategic attempt to get outreach across the Institute, asking the PMU team to share details of PitchFest with their respective programmes and project teams.

This is worth doing, though it is hard to tell how much more impactful this is than using open channels like Slack.

Templates [here](./comms-templates.md)

##### Office Hours
We hosted Office hours twice during the application window.

These were arranged quite ad-hoc, and basically involved us sitting in the kitchen of the Office and on a Zooom for people to come ask questions.

Even though it was ad-hoc, there were still a handful of people who attended to ask questions about the application process so is worth doing.

The second session we brought cookies to entice people to talk to us - which worked a treat!

##### Individual outreach
One of the more effective strategies was to reach out individually to approx 100 enrichment students, using people who were part of the enrichment students channel on Slack.

Although a manual time sink (unless you want to write a script for it...) it felt worth it from an individual engagement perspective.

#### Tasks
- [ ] Identify target audience and methods for engagement
- [ ] Create comms templates so anybody on the team can do outreach
- [ ] Create engagement tracker to determine who you have reached out to
- [ ] Schedule at least one office hour for potential applicants to drop in to.

#### Potential improvements
- We didn't ask people how they heard about PitchFest. It may be good to include this as a question to answer on the application form.
- A bit more planning and outreach for the Office Hours would likely be worth it.
- Some more creative forms of outreach could be good. Or additional opportunities like Turing Town hall, advertising video etc.
- If we decide to include non-Turing people, a lot more thought will be needed for this part of the process.


### Closing applications and judging process
#### Summary
After applications closed we went through the judging process.

Firstly we thanked everybody who applied for applying, and let them know the timelines for when we would let them know of finalists.

For the assessment process, we used a rubrik based on the judging criteria to initially shortlist the applications. 
At least two members of the team should be involved in this process.
We then had a discussion as a team as to who our finalist would be.

Once we had chosen the finalists, we emailed them with further information and instructions, mainly confirming:
- They wanted to take part
- They were free to be in person at AI UK
- They signed up for finalist training (see below)
- They could attend the practice event (see below)

For all non Finalists, we emailed them with some further opportunities, including:
- Possibly recording their pitch more formally after AIUK
- Offering 50% off for AI UK
- Feedback on their pitch




#### Tasks
- [ ] Close the application form
- [ ] Email all those who have applied with further details about the judging process
- [ ] Set aside time with the RAM and events team to shortlist finalists

#### Potential improvements
- Our judging criteria didn't quite deliver on exactly what we were looking for - having more testing of the judging criteria (e.g. maybe RAMs submit their own pitches and we learn from that what we're looking for) would make the process a lot more auditable
