# PitchFest 2023

This page contains a write-up of all the steps that made up PitchFest 2023, run by the Alan Turing Institute at AI UK 2023.

Please feel free to use this as a guide to set up and run your own PitchFest! 
However, please don't take the below as a rigid script - this was our first year running it and we learned a lot to improve for future years.
This is highlighted by a 'potential improvements' heading under each section below.

## Overview
PitchFest broadly consisted of the following steps, which will be broken down below:
- [Preparation](#preparation)
- [Call for applications](#call-for-applications)
- [Closing applications and judging process](#closing-applications-and-judging-process)
- [Finalist training](#finalist-training)
- [Finalist reheasal session](#finalist-reheasal-session)
- [PitchFest event at AIUK](#pitchfest-event-at-aiuk)
- [Wrapping up and next steps](#wrapping-up-and-next-steps)

### Preparation
#### Summary

The first step was to scope out what PitchFest looks like. 
This included considerations for:
- The application process
- The judging criteria
- The event timeline
- The judges
- The prizes

The end output for this stage was the creation of a [PitchFest one pager](https://www.turing.ac.uk/pitchfest-share-your-research-world) to which all applications were directed.

##### Application process
Applicants needed to submit their application via Google Form that contained:
- Their name (required)
- Their Turing role or affiliation (required, only Turing people could apply for PitchFest 2023)
- Pitch title (required)
- Association with a Turing research project (optional)
- Other people involved with the pitch (optional)
- Pitch (required, submission either via text or link to a video or audio recording)
- Any other information (optional)

##### Judging criteria
The judging criteria were determined by the RAM team, and were:
- **Accessibility and communication**: The audience at AI UK is broad with a diverse range of attendees coming from various backgrounds. Is the pitch appropriate for the audience while also being as inclusive and accessible as possible? 
- **Real-world application**: As the national institute for data science and AI, itâ€™s crucial to ensure our research outputs are being applied to solve real-world problems. Does the pitch clearly lay out the motivations for the work and identify real-world applications? 
- **Future directions**: The Turing seeks to build open source infrastructure that is accessible to all. Does the project reflect the principles of openness, reproducibility, and co-creation that ensure a sustainable and meaningful research output? 

##### The event timeline
This was decided by working back from AIUK, to determine how much time we needed for each step. The final timeline was:
- **January 23**: Call for pitches open
- **February 17**: Submissions close
- **February 24**: Finalists notified
- **February 27 / March 6**: Training sessions for finalists
- **March 14**: Rehearsal in Enigma

##### Judges
Sourcing the judges was undertaken by the events nad parternships team, leveraging Turing's pre-existing network.
Suitaible judges were identified who:
- Represented different sectors (academia, private, public)
- Were senior in their respective industries

It was important to source an initial list of judges to include in the one pager.
Further work was done with these judges as the event went on (see below)

##### Prizes
An intiail list of prizes was identified for the winner. As there was no budget for this year's PitchFest, the prize list was focus on skill development, and spotlighting in Turing comms.

Prizes included:
- Public comms (including an announcement and blog post) on your research project
- A mentoring session with the RAM team exploring impact & engagement
- A Turing swag bag
- The glory of winning the first-ever Turing PitchFest!

Eventually a Turing bust was created as the trophy for the winner, which went down really well, this should be included in the future!

The focus of PitchFest should be friendly competition, and the chance to learn how to pitch your work to a broad audience - for all those who take part.
We therefore feel it important to not make the prize too large/swanky, as it may end up promoting the wrong message.

#### Tasks
- [ ] Create a one pager/application form that contains all relevant information, which included the following tasks:
    - [ ] Finalise and communicate the application process
    - [ ] Create an application form
    - [ ] Decide upon judging criteria
    - [ ] Decide event timeline
    - [ ] Identify and confirm initial list of judges
    - [ ] Identify and confirm prizes for winner


#### Potential improvements
##### Application process
- This could possibly be opened up to people outside the Turing in the future
- We ended up only having one person present per pitch - this should be made clear at the application stage
- Creating an FAQs to live on the one pager from common questions we had would be beneficial
- Text pithces didn't work. Video or audio submission should be mandatory.
This should be open for longer so people have more time to apply
- It might be good to share an example good and bad application so people know what they are aiming for (the RAM team should create these)

##### Judging criteria

##### Event timeline
- Everything felt a bit rushed and last minute. Whilst the application window was long enough, there could have been more time for finalist training, the rehearsal in Enigma and the main event. More details below.

##### Judges
- The judges list ebbed and flowed as people became more or less available, beyond the initial application window. Confirming and cementing judges ahead of time would be preferable.

##### Prizes
- With some more funding and preparation time better prizes could be offered, e.g. networking or skill development opportunities. However these should not be so large as to create too intense a competition, or risk excluding non-winners from good development opportunities.
- We may also want to consider layered prizes, e.g. opportunities for those who apply, the finalists and the winner.

### Call for applications
You can see [our collection of comms templates here](./comms-templates.md)

#### Summary
This part of the process was mainly focused on Outreach to possible applicants.

PitchFest 2023 was open to anybody with a Turing affiliation, including any researchers working on a Turing project, Turing Fellows, and Enrichments Students. 
Researchers could apply either individually or as a project team.

The main outreach focused on:
- Posting in relevant Turing Slack channels
- Asking PMU to forward the opportunity on 
- Hosting Office hours for anyone that had questions
- Individual reachout to enrichment students via Slack

We had a range of people apply, but decided to focus upon enrichment students specifically, as we felt they would be most receptive to the opportunity.
Nevertheless, we had applications (17 in total) from both enrichment students and Turing researchers.

All people that applied would probably be classified as early career researchers.
This is what we expected, and may influence who you choose to reach out to!

##### Slack channel posting
We had some general comms options that we shared in key Slack channels.

You can see templates [here](./comms-templates.md). 
This may feel a little bit spam-y - remember that this is a cool opportunity that people should know about!

##### PMU outreach
This was a more strategic attempt to get outreach across the Institute, asking the PMU team to share details of PitchFest with their respective programmes and project teams.

This is worth doing, though it is hard to tell how much more impactful this is than using open channels like Slack.

Templates [here](./comms-templates.md)

##### Office Hours
We hosted Office hours twice during the application window.

These were arranged quite ad-hoc, and basically involved us sitting in the kitchen of the Office and on a Zooom for people to come ask questions.

Even though it was ad-hoc, there were still a handful of people who attended to ask questions about the application process so is worth doing.

The second session we brought cookies to entice people to talk to us - which worked a treat!

##### Individual outreach
One of the more effective strategies was to reach out individually to approx 100 enrichment students, using people who were part of the enrichment students channel on Slack.

Although a manual time sink (unless you want to write a script for it...) it felt worth it from an individual engagement perspective.

#### Tasks
- [ ] Identify target audience and methods for engagement
- [ ] Create comms templates so anybody on the team can do outreach
- [ ] Create engagement tracker to determine who you have reached out to
- [ ] Schedule at least one office hour for potential applicants to drop in to.

#### Potential improvements
- We didn't ask people how they heard about PitchFest. It may be good to include this as a question to answer on the application form.
- A bit more planning and outreach for the Office Hours would likely be worth it.
- Some more creative forms of outreach could be good. Or additional opportunities like Turing Town hall, advertising video etc.
- If we decide to include non-Turing people, a lot more thought will be needed for this part of the process.


### Closing applications and judging process
#### Summary
After applications closed we went through the judging process.

Firstly we thanked everybody who applied for applying, and let them know the timelines for when we would let them know of finalists.

For the assessment process, we used a rubrik based on the judging criteria to initially shortlist the applications. 
At least two members of the team should be involved in this process.
We then had a discussion as a team as to who our finalist would be.

Once we had chosen the finalists, we emailed them with further information and instructions, mainly confirming:
- They wanted to take part
- They were free to be in person at AI UK
- They signed up for finalist training (see below)
- They could attend the practice event (see below)

For all non Finalists, we emailed them with some further opportunities, including:
- Possibly recording their pitch more formally after AIUK
- Offering 50% off for AI UK
- Feedback on their pitch


#### Tasks
- [ ] Close the application form
- [ ] Email all those who have applied with further details about the judging process
- [ ] Set aside time with the RAM and events team to shortlist finalists

#### Potential improvements
- Our judging criteria didn't quite deliver on exactly what we were looking for - having more testing of the judging criteria (e.g. maybe RAMs submit their own pitches and we learn from that what we're looking for) would make the process a lot more auditable
- Mainly from a timing perspective we didn't follow up with formal recordings for those who applied. We should be careful to only offer what we wan deliver on!
- You may want to create a more formal judging panel beyond your specific team

### Finalist training
#### Summary
We ran 1-1 training sessions for finalists over the course of a week.

Finalists booked 30 minute slots over [Calendly](https://calendly.com/pitchfest/30min?month=2023-09).

The structure of the session was:
- Remind them of the judging criteria
- Have them practice their pitch
- Give group feedback in the room
- Have them practice again
- Cover next steps

##### Judging criteria
We reminded them of the judging criteria, and how judging would work on the day at AIUK (judges provide feedback, audience votes for favourite).

##### Practicing their pitch
Almost all finalists were nervous about doing this. 
However, we helped them understand the importance of starting to practice the pitch, and that its uncomfortable to do it for the first time but the best way to improve it quickly.
We also timed the pitches to get pitchers used to the idea of being under time pressure.

Some of them practiced more than once.
This is definitely a case of reading the room and providing the appropriate level of support/feedback to pitchers.

##### Group feedback
We started this part by asking the pitchers themselves how they thought the pitch went (what was good, what could be improved etc.). 
We then went around the room and shared some thoughts on how the pitch could be improved.

This feedback ranged from delivery style, to restructuring the content, to suggesting including/dropping content.

##### Next steps
Next steps included:
- Working on asynchronous improvements to scripts on Google Docs (collaboratively with the RAM team)
- Preparing for the rehearsal session
- Making ourselves available for any final support questions in Collaboration Cafes

We also emailed participants with key feedback from the session to help them improve their pitch

#### Tasks
- [ ] Get finalists to book into a training session
- [ ] Plan the structure of the training sessions
- [ ] Setup additional support mechanisms (e.g. script editing)
- [ ] Record feedback on participants' pitches that can be shared with them afterwards

#### Potential improvements
- These sessions could benefit from being longer - perhaps 45 mins per participant
- Ideally everyone should be in the room for this. Online can work but it's not the same, and participants need to practice pitching with an audience.
- We provided ad hoc feedback on the day, which worked well. However RAMs going in with a more in-depth/expert knowledge on what makes a good presentation, that we can both feedback to pitchers and share resources with them, would be next level
- Improving the scripts asynchronously was done as a last minute improvement, however was on of the most important bits of support we offered! Time should be given for this to be done properly, maybe over a week or two, with conscious input and feedback from a range of people.
- After the fact, pitchers mentioned how they worked and shaped the pitch with their project teams. More structured feedback opportunities from project teams/experts could be introduced here to really take pitches to the next level

### Finalist reheasal session
#### Summary
The rehearsal session was hsoted in Enigma for 1.5 hours the week before AI UK.

We required all participants to learn their pitches off by heart, and be present in the Office for the session.
The tone of the session was a fun, safe space for pitches to practice their pitches and get feedback from other participants, and others in the room.

We brought some snacks and kept it casual. 
We gave a brief intro presentation about what to expect at AI UK, before giving each participant a chance to give their pitch.
We then opened the floor to feedback from those in the room, before giving participants the chance to practice their pitches again.

This event should be hybrid so people can join online.

#### Tasks
- [ ] Book a big room for the rehearsal
- [ ] Prepare the tone of the session (e.g. snacks, initial presentation etc.). Keeping the tone light and informal worked really well.
- [ ] Ensure the right people are in the room to providfe feedback
- [ ] Ensure you have an online facilitator

#### Potential improvements
- Due to the short-term warning, we didn't have many people attend the session who weren't involved in PitchFest. In the end this created quite a nice, safe environment for all participants to support each other. However, a possible improvement may be to get more people in the room to listen to pitches, and possibly someone senior from Turing. Another option is to have two rehearsal sessions, one with just the participants and a few others (keep the supportive, safe atmosphere) and one with a lot more Turing people (to practice the public speaking element). This could be a day event - morning with just the pitchers, lunch, afternoon with other Turing people.
- More time should be given to plan and promote this

### PitchFest event at AIUK
#### Summary
The big day!

Hopefully you would have a lot of event support for the day.
We required all pitchers, judges and the host to arrive 30 minutes early back stage to be mic'ed up and prepare for their pitches. 

Participants gave their presentations in front of a static slide (they are not allowed any slides themselves).
This was followed by feedback from a selection of the expert judging panel

Audience vote was then cast by Slido, with the winner given on a folded piece of paper to the host. 
While the auidence was voting the judges were consulted on what makes a good pitch, good research, and what they understand impact to mean.

The winner was then provided with a trophy, before giving a little speech.

It would be good to sit in the front row to be available to help with any last minute preparations


#### Tasks
- [ ] Prepare posts to go out on institutional and personal socials
- [ ] Create a one pager for judges to understand what is required from them, and also a cheat sheet for them on the day to score/keep notes on each pitch
- [ ] Create a one pager/script for the host
- [ ] Prepare the slides to go behind the pitchers
- [ ] Be on hand to help with any last minute logistics
- [ ] Prepare Slido for voting

#### Potential improvements
- It would've been good to have a space afterwards for everyone to come talk to the finalists. This could be a stall at AI UK, or some kind of reception outside the main room. It would be good for the RAM team to also be there to answer any questions
- (A bit selfish), but it might be good to plug the RAM team/your team during the event - perhaps in the period when the audience is voting.
- It would've been good to practice once with Pitchers on the stage itself before the event, so they could familiarise themselves with where to stand and also get a feel for the size of the room/audience
- A prize for all finalists would be good - maybe PitchFest T-shirts?
- For outreach ahead of time, it would be cool to hae some slides/graphics on the finalists that can be shared publicly to build hype, and give them some exposure
- Judges should be given more time to be booked into PitchFest, and told what they will need to do
- It might be cool to have last year's winner be a judge at the next one!

### Wrapping up and next steps
#### Summary
There were a few things we actioned after the event, including:
- A debrief with the finalists
- A debrief with the organising team
- Comms through the Turing network about the winner

##### Debrief with finalists
This was really important to get finalists feedback on how the process went, what could be improved for next time and also to get some stories of their experience we could use for promotion (which we never did)

##### Debrief with organising team
Hopefully obvious, key to do this soon after the event whilst it's still on everyone's minds and you can record possible improvements

##### Comms through Turing networks
Make sure you know what this will look like ahead of time

#### Tasks
- [ ] Decide what you will offer all participants (winner, finalists, non-finalists) ahead of time
- [ ] Ensure all processes are in place to deliver on these offerings
- [ ] Hold debrief sessions with both finalists and the organising team soon after the event to capture feedback
- [ ] Claim back all relevant expenses

#### Potential improvements
- We ran out of steam a bit at this stage. Figuring out what we can offer finalists and participants ahead of time and planning for it is a critical improvement for next time
- It would've been cool to do a blog post/article or something on PitchFest that we could've shared with people afterwards, including quotes from those who took part. This would embed PitchFest and its awesomeness further in the public psyche
- Some things became difficult to organise (e.g. recording all pitches and sharing them on the Turing YT) because we didn't organise them in advance. Making sure this is all prepared in advance is important, otherwise you risk letting this slide like we did.
