# Research Application Management
## Developing research outputs for real-world problem solving while ensuring openness and reproducibility

Research Application Managers (RAMs) focus on the sustainability and impact of research, guiding the development and use of research outputs for a broad set of stakeholders. The [role of a RAM](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/research-infrastructure-roles/ram.html) was created at the Turing to help fill the gaps between purely academic knowledge generation and the work that is required to create and maintain user-friendly tools that can be used to address questions beyond the scope of the original research field. RAM engagements can begin at any time in the project lifecycle, and we encourage researchers to reach out to the RAM team as early as possible so that we can incorporate the user perspective and consider possible applications in the development of research outputs.

## What skills do RAMs bring to research teams?
RAMs think [beyond the research project cycle](https://journal.trialanderror.org/pub/manifesto-rewarding-recognizing/release/1), creating opportunities to reuse and reproduce research outputs in new real-world applications. At the Turing, RAMs bring product development and stakeholder engagement skills to research teams and cultivate a practice of open collaboration, encouraging interconnectedness of research within the Institute and beyond.

As a team, we develop and deliver an end-to-end stakeholder engagement strategy focused on adapting research outputs to be more user friendly. 
This includes deliverables like:
* Stakeholder mapping
* Requirements gathering & alignment
* User testing & user-centred design
* Research output development roadmapping
* Workshop delivery

## What makes for an impactful RAM engagement?
We consider multiple dimensions of a research project and team to prioritise engagement across Turing's research projects:
* **Applicability**: How much potential does a research project have for real-world use?
* **Capability**: To what extent does the team have the skills to translate their research to real-world use?
* **Values**: How much does the team's approach to research align with our focus areas (e.g. interoperable open source tools, interdisciplinary collaboration, participatory co-creation)
* **Practices**: How ready are the team to adopt RAM ways of working?

## Examples of our work
* Open sourcing the [Data Safe Haven](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/data-safe-havens-cloud), bringing the community together to co-create [a reference TRE architecture](https://github.com/sa-tre/satre-specification) and creating a [national community for Trusted Research Environments](https://github.com/uk-tre/website)
* Integrating A/B street for [use in a Bristol City Council public consultation tool](https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/street-smart-putting-neighbourhood-design-hands-bristol-residents) to empower residents to design and assess street-level interventions in their neighbourhoods
* Delivering cross-sector workshops with government and industry stakeholders in 'Health' and 'Autonomy' fields on behalf of the [AI Standards Hub](https://aistandardshub.org/)
* Creating [PitchFest at AI UK](https://www.turing.ac.uk/pitchfest-share-your-research-world) to upskill Early Career Researchers to communicate the impact of their research to a public audience
* Co-authoring public-facing whitepapers on Turing's [Environment & Sustainability](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/publications/tackling-climate-change-data-science-and-ai) and [Digital Twins](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/publications/towards-ecosystems-connected-digital-twins-address-global-challenges) research
