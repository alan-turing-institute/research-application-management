# Research Application Management
## Amplifying Sustainability and Impact of research outputs

The [RAM role](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/research-infrastructure-roles/ram.html) was pioneered at the Turing in order to **fill the gap** between academic knowledge generation and practical tool creation. 
RAMs collaborate with research teams to make their research output **more relevant** for a broad audience within and beyond the scope of the original research field.
By focusing on the **user perspective**, RAMs increase the **sustainability** and the **impact** of research outputs. 

Are you a researcher interested in amplifying the impact of your work? Engage with the RAM team at any stage of your project, but the earlier, the better. We'll integrate impact into your project plan from the start. Check out our impact matrix below to see if your project could benefit from working with a RAM.

## What project impact have RAMs delivered?
* Open sourcing the [Data Safe Haven](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/data-safe-havens-cloud), bringing the community together to co-create [a reference TRE architecture](https://github.com/sa-tre/satre-specification) and creating a [national community for Trusted Research Environments](https://github.com/uk-tre/website)
* Integrating A/B street for [use in a Bristol City Council public consultation tool](https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/street-smart-putting-neighbourhood-design-hands-bristol-residents) to empower residents to design and assess street-level interventions in their neighbourhoods
* Delivering cross-sector workshops with government and industry stakeholders in 'Health' and 'Autonomy' fields on behalf of the [AI Standards Hub](https://aistandardshub.org/)
* Creating [PitchFest at AI UK](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/first-pitchfest-winner-announced-ai-uk-2023) to upskill Early Career Researchers to communicate the impact of their research to a public audience
* Co-authoring public-facing whitepapers on Turing's [Environment & Sustainability](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/publications/tackling-climate-change-data-science-and-ai) and [Digital Twins](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/publications/towards-ecosystems-connected-digital-twins-address-global-challenges) research

## What makes for an impactful RAM engagement?
In our **RAM impact matrix**, we consider multiple dimensions of a research project and team to prioritise engagement across Turing's research projects:
* **Applicability**: How much potential does the research project have for real-world use?
* **Capability**: To what extent does the team have the skills to translate their research to real-world use?
* **Values**: How much does the team's approach to research align with our focus areas within the [Tools, Practices, and Systems (TPS) programme](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems)? (e.g. interoperable open source tools, interdisciplinary collaboration, participatory co-creation)
* **Practices**: How ready is the team to adopt RAM ways of working?

## What do RAMs bring to research teams?

Effective research has the potential to do more than answer a specific research question. For a project to maximise its impact, the team should consider questions like:
- Who might use this research when it is completed, and how might they benefit from it?
- Who will be affected by the research, and what outcomes would they like to see?
- Does the research project consider sustainability beyond a specific funding window?
- How does the work fit into the wider landscape of research in my field and other fields?

The RAM skillset is focused on effectively exploring and answering these questions. Below are some examples of what this could entail:

| Focus area | Motivation | Example activities |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| End-to-end stakeholder engagement and co-creation | Ensuring that all impacted and involved people, particularly end users, are identified early, brought into the research project and actively considered when shaping outputs | Stakeholder mapping; stakeholder engagement pipelines; organising, facilitating and managing engagement activities; translating engagement outcomes to inform research |
| Usability and accessiblity of research outputs | Ensuring that anybody who wants to can access and engage with the research outputs | Writing cleaner, easier to understand code; creating documentation, guides and educational resources to support core research outputs; open-sourcing research datasets, models, and other outputs (when possible) |
| Delivering project strategy | Prioritising work to practically realise as much potential as possible from limited resources, funds and time | Facilitating the creation of a team strategy and project roadmap; identifying sustainability options beyond funding windows; identifying and implementing a target project pathway to maximise impact potential |

A key characteristic of RAMs is our flexibility, as there is no one-size-fits-all approach to delivering impact for research project teams. RAMs will work to identify suitable pathways to sustainability and impact for any particular project, and leading on the implementation of that target pathway.
