# Research Application Management
## Amplifying Sustainability and Impact of research outputs

The [RAM role](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/research-infrastructure-roles/ram.html) was pioneered at the Turing in order to **bridge the gap** between academic knowledge generation and practical tool creation. 
RAMs **collaborate** with researchers to make their research output **more relevant** for a **broad audience** beyond the scope of the original research field.
By focusing on the **user-perspective**, RAMs increase the **sustainability** and the **impact** of research outputs. 

Are you a researcher interested in amplifying your the impact of your work? Engage with the RAM team at any stage of your project, but the earlier, the better. We'll integrate impact into your plan from the start. Check our impact matrix below to see if your project could benefit from working with a RAM.

## What project impact have RAMs delivered?
* Open sourcing the [Data Safe Haven](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/data-safe-havens-cloud), bringing the community together to co-create [a reference TRE architecture](https://github.com/sa-tre/satre-specification) and creating a [national community for Trusted Research Environments](https://github.com/uk-tre/website)
* Integrating A/B street for [use in a Bristol City Council public consultation tool](https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/street-smart-putting-neighbourhood-design-hands-bristol-residents) to empower residents to design and assess street-level interventions in their neighbourhoods
* Delivering cross-sector workshops with government and industry stakeholders in 'Health' and 'Autonomy' fields on behalf of the [AI Standards Hub](https://aistandardshub.org/)
* Creating [PitchFest at AI UK](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/first-pitchfest-winner-announced-ai-uk-2023) to upskill Early Career Researchers to communicate the impact of their research to a public audience
* Co-authoring public-facing whitepapers on Turing's [Environment & Sustainability](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/publications/tackling-climate-change-data-science-and-ai) and [Digital Twins](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/publications/towards-ecosystems-connected-digital-twins-address-global-challenges) research

## What makes for an impactful RAM engagement?
In our RAM impact matrix, we consider multiple dimensions of a research project and team to prioritise engagement across Turing's research projects:
* **Applicability**: How much potential does a research project have for real-world use?
* **Capability**: To what extent does the team have the skills to translate their research to real-world use?
* **Values**: How much does the team's approach to research align with our focus areas (e.g. interoperable open source tools, interdisciplinary collaboration, participatory co-creation)
* **Practices**: How ready is the team to adopt RAM ways of working?

## How can I learn more about the specific skills that RAMs bring to research teams?
RAMs think [beyond the research project cycle](https://journal.trialanderror.org/pub/manifesto-rewarding-recognizing/release/1), creating opportunities to reuse and reproduce research outputs in new real-world applications. At the Turing, RAMs bring product development and stakeholder engagement skills to research teams and cultivate a practice of open collaboration, encouraging interconnectedness of research within the Institute and beyond.

As a team, we develop and deliver an end-to-end stakeholder engagement strategy focused on adapting research outputs to be more user friendly. 
This includes deliverables like:
* Stakeholder mapping: identifying who is involved in or impacted by a research collaboration
* Requirements gathering: aligning stakeholders on shared language and goals
* User testing & user-centred design: applying design methodologies to research output creation 
* Workshop delivery: designing and delivering an effective workshop with diverse stakeholders
