# RAM Webpage draft

## What makes for an impactful application of research?

To support the identification of research projects that are conducive to real world application and impact, the Research Application Management team has developed the RAM rhombus (also nicknamed "RAMallelogram").

The RAM rhombus helps us decide where our team should prioritise engagement across the Turing research projects. 
The rhombus has 4 key dimensions, defined below:
* **Impact:** how much potential does the research have for adoption by users?
* **Capabilities:** what skills for developing applications does the team already have?
* **Value alignment:** how much does the team culture prioritise aspects like: transparent research processes, trustworthy systems, participatory co-creation, public engagement, sustainable innovation, interoperable open source infrastructure, and inclusive, interdisciplinary teamwork?
* **Operational alignment:** how far has the team gone to operationalise and set up infrastructure to support the above values?
