## Aim


## Angle
- Helping projects identify pathways towards real-world impact, and prepare for and oeprationalise Turing 2.0
    - Turing 2.0 has a strong focus on innovation and impact

## Method
- Interview X number of Turing research projects to understand where they are currently at with key questions
    - Interview at least one person per project
        - Ideally the PI, but if hard to pin down anyone from the research team
- 30 or 45 min semi-structured interviews
    - Interviews don't need to follow set question order/format

## General questions
*Do some background research on the project to make this less formulaic and extractive*
- Can you provide a _quick_ summary of your project?
    - Can you describe the current status of your project and what you are building towards?
    - Who your partners/key relationships are/were?
    - How much funding you have/had and where it comes from?
        - And how long your project is running for?
    - Your team make up (size and roles)?

## Impact potential
- What motivates your research question?
- Where do you hope your research will end up?
- What does impact and/or success mean to you for your project?
- What are you doing now to try to achieve this impact/success?
- What is preventing you from achieving this impact?

## Operational Alignment
- What is your current way of working?
- What is your current governance structure for the project?
- What roles do you see as important to have on your team?


## Values
- How much do you think about/have you thought about
    - Open, reproducible outputs?
    - Co-creation with the end user?
    - Participatory science?
- What is your approach to research and research outputs?
    - Do you follow any particular best practices/frameworks in your work?
    - 
    - Are you willing to forego your work to incorporate it within a larger project?
    - Are you willing to have this research used in ways outside of your control?
    - Are you comfortable with 'free-riders'?
    - Are you willing to use pre-existing tools/platforms etc. to augment your project?

## Performance
### Audience
- Do you know who your audience/users are?
    - Where those who will use it already are
    - Where those who regulate it already are
    - Where those that make decisions based on it already are
    - Where those that are impacted by it already are
- Do you know where these people are?
- Are you already engaged with these people and these places?
- Do you know what people in these spaces need?
- Does your work align with/relate to other community work?
- Was the question for the research asked by this community or not?
- Do you regularly communicate with your community?

### Accessibility & openness
- Do you have documentation for people to learn about your project?
- Do you have educational resources available for those interested to upskill and engage?
- Do you proactively make openly available all aspects of your project that can be?

### Reusability
- Are others able to pick up your projects easily?
- Is it clear what skills and resources you need to pick up these projects?
- Do you know what operating models could be used to sustain this work?
- Are barriers to re-use factored in to your team's approach?

### Sustainability and scope
- Do you know where your research ends and where next steps begin?
    - Does your aims/goals of the research match your funding windows/resources available?
    - Are you prepared for funding for your project to cease?
    - Do you know what your minimum, non-negotiable level of success is?
    - Do you know when the research project is officially done, and it's potential/impact has been realised?

### Governance
- How can people outside the project team get involved with the project?
- How will people be able to get involved once the project funding has finished?

### Project design
- Do you have a project roadmap?
- Do you have collaborative workspaces set up? Version control?
- Do you have an organised and explicit way of working within your project team?
- Do you know what outputs you are aiming for from your project?

### Thoughts
#### How to pitch this
- Forwarding TPS and RAM goals within the Institute
- This is also a chance to share what the RAMs do and what we're here to do
- They might just enjoy the process of telling people about their research
- Can we do a bit of research on the side, and mention something that they are already struggling with
