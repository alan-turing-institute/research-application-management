# ATI RAM Events Checklist

Here is a checklist of steps to take and resources to refer to when organising a Turing event.

## Setting up the Event
1. Decide whether or not you need the support of the Events team (usually for a large, high profile event with external audience included). (If yes, work with RPM to submit [Events and engagement request form](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=2334&SearchId=18818&utm_source=interact&utm_medium=quick_search&utm_term=event)) 
2. Decide whether or not the event has an in-person component. (If yes, notify Events team and contact Facilities to reserve room).
3. Work with RPM to create [Zoom event registration page](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/211579443-Scheduling-a-meeting-with-registration).
4. Decide whether or not you need an event page on the Turing website. (If yes, work with [website team](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=2323&SearchId=18827&utm_source=interact&utm_medium=general_search&utm_term=website+template) to fill out website template and share speaker bio/photos if they do not have a Turing profile already).
5. Promote event link / registration info through Slack, Twitter, LinkedIn and other distribution channels. (If you require Turing support, contact the [marketing team](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=2325&SearchId=18852&utm_source=interact&utm_medium=general_search&utm_term=social+media)).

## Preparing for the Event
6. Ensure speakers have the correct meeting joining info and can join earlier to test microphone/slides, if needed.
7. If there is a Zoom component, make sure the settings are appropriate. (e.g. speakers as "Hosts", chat permissions, microphone permissions)
8. If you need a Slido or other Q&A/discussion tool, work with Events to set it up.
9. Review the Events [Content Moderation Guidance](https://thealanturininstitute.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/ee/Ec7MKsPEP6hJt00df8EhEQwBPOaCdDM1FVG4oxjnS_sOSg) for advice and resources on how to address different disruptive situations.
10. Decide whether or not you will record the event and notify audience if you do.

## After the Event

11. If you plan to publish a video, collect a signed Speaker Release from all speakers, make the video downloadable so Video team can accept it and add request for deadline. Send this and the request to publish the video to the Turing Video team.
