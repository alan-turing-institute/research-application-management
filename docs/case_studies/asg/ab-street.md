# AB street

[Project Page](http://ltn.abstreet.org/)

### RAM engagement: May 2022 - March 2023

## Description:
* A/B street has created an online tool that can help residents and planners have a shared canvas for discussing potential street-level changes, 
such as planting street trees or installing a model filter to encourage cycling and walking.

## Impact Highlights
* Integration in Bristol City Council LTN public consultation in Autumn 2022
* Creating training material for city council members and the general public
* EDT highlight: A/B street's LTN tool allows for testing urban planning interventions on an interactive interface representing a digital twin of
traffic levels within a city. The technology simulates the impact of traffic re-routing if different street-level changes were made (e.g. modal filter,
bollards, conversion to one-way street). This tool allows planners to take into consideration the city-level impacts of specific changes to evaluate
the network effects on transportation across across a street, neighbourhood, and city.

## Stakeholder engagement
* Create materials for use of tool in Bristol City Council public consultation ([intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m22WP62yyZ0), [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j64ZtDfGPCY), [user guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vU4xITmd9PMX4QJi0xP5ZJVpuWE9rpE3SvvYdq9_xb8/edit?usp=sharing))
