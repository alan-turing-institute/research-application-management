# Quantifying the Expected Value of Data

### RAM engagement: June 2022 - March 2023

## Description:
* There are an increasing number of techologies for data collection from engineering assets - but how much data is required, 
how good does it need to be, and how much should engineers be willing to pay for it? Using ‘Value of Information’ (VoI) analysis, 
it is possible to understand how and to what extent prospective data is expected to support decision making. 

## Impact Highlights
* RAM creation of 1-pager to share with external stakeholders
* EDT highlight: Research directions like Value of Information provide supporting tools in the Digital Twins ecosystem, particularly for 
applications requiring decision-making under uncertainty around a major asset or system like the built enviornment. This decision process can help 
quantify the expected value of data collection for a given project, answering questions like "A strain gauge has stopped functioning in my bridge - 
should I replace it?" or "How much should I be willing to pay for a smart meter?"
