# EnergyFlex

## RAM engagement: February 2022 - September 2022

## Impact Highlights
* EnergyFlex has created a microsimulation tool that can model individual households in a local area and estimate energy consumption and socio-economic context at a high resolution. The tool is co-designed with public/private housing stakeholders to address challenges faced by local government, developers, and other stakeholders in implementing energy retrofits and decarbonisation efforts
* EnergyFlex model is available on DAFNI
* EDT highlight: EnergyFlex has integrated building & energy datasets in order to create a representative model or "digital twin" of the UK's housing stock for microsimulation. The building-level granularity allows for targeted energy retrofit analysis so policymakers can experiment with different interventions and quantify the impact at local, regional, and national scales.

## Stakeholder engagement
* Facilitate AI UK 2022 Panel with stakeholders from Cambridge U, Parity Projects, and Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research ([notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pDDuoISwnVpP-955YYVKNIuaBlBR-l1TrqNpYTVRdUM/edit#heading=h.6avkr0nu6axo))
