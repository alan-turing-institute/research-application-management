### RAM engagement: January 2022 to March 2023

## Description
* IceNet is a probablistic sea ice forcasting system that predicts the extent of sea ice in the Arctic. Using deep learning, IceNet outperforms physics-based sea ice forecasts and can predict monthly average Arctic sea ice coverage with accuracies of up to 97%.

## Impact highlights
* AI UK workshop in March of 2022 leading to ongoing collaboration with UKHO
* Pilot project with WWF studying the use of IceNet to help understand Caribou migration patterns in the Canadian Arctic.
