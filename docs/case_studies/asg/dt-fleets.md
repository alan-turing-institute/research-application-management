# DTs for Fleet Modelling

### RAM engagement: January 2022 - March 2023

## Description: method to improve the predictive capability of asset management algorithms by learning from 
Data recorded from an entire fleet - rather than individual systems. By considering populations as a whole, 
such as trucks in a transportation network or turbines in a wind farm, the data available for training can be (in effect) extended. 
This mode of inference can improve the predictive performance while reducing the uncertainty in the models that approximate fleet status

## Impact Highlights
* RAM creation of 1-pager to share with external stakeholders
* EDT highlight: By constructing digital twins of distributed fleets, 
Fleet Monitoring delivers enhanced asset management through better performance and efficiency for the entire population.
Fleet Monitoring is collaborating with Scania to support survival analysis and prognostics for their truck fleets, 
reducing down-time and maintenance costs. By sharing data between turbines, Fleet Monitoring can help wind farms improve their power output predictions 
for reliable performance monitoring and forecasting.
