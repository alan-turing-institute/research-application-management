*A The Turing Way inspired project to share resources for research application management.*

## About this Repository

This repository includes files and resources recommended for stakeholder engagement and application management for research projects, created by researchers at The Alan Turing Instiute. Learn more about our team [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems/research-application-management).

This repository follows the recommendations and guidance provided in *[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome)* handbook to data science.
When reusing this repository, please update information on your README page with information about your project.
