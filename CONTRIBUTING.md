The **Reproducible Project Template** repository is developed under ***[The Turing Way](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way)* to demonstrate the practical integration of reproducibility practices on the collaborative or shared online repository**.

This project is being developed **openly** and invites contributions from **anyone interested** in reproducible data science who would like to get involved.
You can suggest topics to include in this repository, report mistakes/bugs, create Pull Requests to fix an error, offer resources or help develop or review the training materials.

We have a [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that applies to all the activities related to this project.

- For open tasks in this repository, please see the [Issues section](../../issues).
- Raise mistakes, errors or missing information on this repository by opening a [Pull Request](../../pulls)
  - Read details on [how to open a Pull Request](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request)
  - Submit trivial fixes (for example, a typo, a broken link or an obvious error)
  - Start work on a contribution that is already listed as an issue or something you‚Äôve already discussed
  - A Pull Request doesn‚Äôt have to represent finished work. It‚Äôs usually better to open a Pull Request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Just mark it as a ‚ÄúWIP‚Äù (Work in Progress) in the subject line. You can always add more commits later.
