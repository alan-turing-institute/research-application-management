# First week onboarding checklist

This document provides checklists to cover the logistical items that will enable onboarding of a new RAM member!
This session should probably be one of the first sessions the new team member does - it's best to schedule a meeting with an existing team member to go through the list of sign-ups and answer any questions, but the line manager and new team member should also use this checklist to confirm that all of these items have been completed by the end of the first week.

Time required: 1 hour

## Line manager checklist
[] add new team member to ram@turing.ac.uk email distribution
  [] show them how to display and edit the RAM calendar
- Help them determine what Work From Home equipment they need, and request it from IT
- Introduce the [Turing learning platform](https://turing.learnupon.com/dashboard) and flag that they need to complete the required training
- Make sure they're on the invite for general Turing events e.g. Turing Town Halls.
- Run them through the hgih level Turing org structure 

###Â Tools (15 mins)
- Introduce Turing Complete/Mathison
- Help them to set up an HR onboarding session (if it's not been arranged yet)
- Introduce them to SharePoint, especially the [RAM Sharepoint](https://thealanturininstitute.sharepoint.com/sites/RAM)

## After the session

Be a friendly point of contact for any Turing questions they may have!
