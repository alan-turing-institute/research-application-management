# General Onboarding session

This file contains the information to cover in the general onboarding session for a new RAM member!
This session should probably be one of the first sessions the new team member does.

Time required: 1 hour

## Before the session
- Touch base with their project team to find out where they store any useful resources. Collate these into a pack for the new starter!

## During the session

### General setup (15 mins)
- Help them determine what Work From Home equipment they need, and request it from IT
- Introduce the [Turing learning platform](https://turing.learnupon.com/dashboard) and flag that they need to complete the required training
- Make sure they're on the invite for general Turing events e.g. Turing Town Halls.
- Run them through the hgih level Turing org structure 

### Tools (15 mins)
- Introduce Turing Complete/Mathison
- Help them to set up an HR onboarding session (if it's not been arranged yet)
- Introduce them to SharePoint, especially the [RAM Sharepoint](https://thealanturininstitute.sharepoint.com/sites/RAM)

## After the session

Be a friendly point of contact for any Turing questions they may have!
