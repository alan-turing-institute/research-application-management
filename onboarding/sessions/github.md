# GitHub onboarding session

This file contains the information to cover in the GitHub onboarding session for a new RAM member!
This session should probably take place after the sessions introducing them to TPS-associated projects, like the Turing Way and Whitaker Lab, as well as 'RAM life'

Time required: 30 mins

## Before the session
* Find out which projects they're working on. Ensure that, as part of the projects' onboarding plans, they have set aside specific time to introduce them to the GitHub repos the project works with.

## During the session

* Make sure they have a GitHub account (create one if required).
* Get them to sign up to become a member of the Alan Turing Institute Organisation on GitHub via [this form](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/serviceflow?unid=3844fabf8b1c45ca9028758a350ff230&from=c56ec576-4ee8-4b07-8bde-9f9f45b6d561&openedFromService=true)
* If they're not familiar with GitHub, help them to organise a GitHub onboarding/training session. A good place to start is reach out to the Turing Way team to see whether any Intro to GitHub sessions are running soon - if not there are recordings of sessions they can watch!
* Introduce them to the main repos they will need to familairise themselves with on a RAM side:
    - **[Turing Way](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way)**
        - Add them as a collaborator
        - Introduce the book
        - Tasks for them to complete:
            - Read through the README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT (and more if it interests them!)
            - Add their name to `contributors.md`
    - **[RAM Repo](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-application-management)**
        - Add them to the repo
        - Walk through the project board
        - Describe what the repo is for
    - **[Whitaker Lab](https://github.com/WhitakerLab)**
        - Add them to the repo
        - Create a folder for them in `weekly-updates`, and describe to them how this works
    - **[Reproducible project template]**
        - Introduce them to this template, and why it could be useful to them on their projects
* Help them coordinate GitHub onboarding sessions for their projects

## After the session

Be a friendly point of contact for any GitHub questions they may have!
