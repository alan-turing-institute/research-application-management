# Objectives: Probation Period

## Background Info

In the first six months at Turing, new starters are in a probationary period for which they will
set goals for review at the end of probation. To learn more about the Probation process and timelines,
see this [Mathison document](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/page/2466).

The target is for the new starter to set objectives within week 1-3 with an assessment 
at the 5 months mark.

## Example RAM Objectives for Probation

These objectives were created by new RAMs in the AI for Science and Government (ASG) programme.

1. Contribute to Turing research impact through stakeholder communication and engagement activities
-  Facilitate the publication of 1-2 impact stories with the Comms team
-  Organise workshop with external stakeholder

2. Scope and kickstart 2-3 RAM engagements across the programme
- Meet with multiple researchers in the programme to asssess readiness for RAM engagement
- Make connections within the programme and beyond in the wider Turing network 

3. Upskill on RAM, TPS, and TTW ways of working & identify opportunities to feed back
- Open issues and begin contributing to the RAM and TTW repos
- Co-create workshop to bring RAM or TTW practices and values to other Turing programmes and communities
