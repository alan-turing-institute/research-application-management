# Objective Setting

## Probation

In the first six months at Turing, new starters are in a probationary period for which they will
set goals for review at the end of probation. 
To learn more about the Probation process and timelines,
see this [Mathison document](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/page/2466).

The target is for the new starter to set objectives within week 1-3 with an assessment 
at the 5 months mark. 
It is recommended to use the [SMART goals framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria).

### Example RAM Objectives for Probation

These objectives were created by new RAMs in the AI for Science and Government (ASG) programme.

1. Contribute to Turing research impact through stakeholder communication and engagement activities
-  Facilitate the publication of 1-2 impact stories with the Comms team
-  Organise workshop with external stakeholder

2. Scope and kickstart 2-3 RAM engagements across the programme
- Meet with multiple researchers in the programme to asssess readiness for RAM engagement
- Make connections within the programme and beyond in the wider Turing network 

3. Upskill on RAM, TPS, and TTW ways of working & identify opportunities to feed back
- Open issues and begin contributing to the RAM and TTW repos
- Co-create workshop to bring RAM or TTW practices and values to other Turing programmes and communities

## Appraisal

Every year, Turing runs an appraisal process which consists of objective setting for performance review and is part of any performance-related pay discussion.
Objectives are set in September and will be reviewed again in May of the next year.
That process consists of a self evaluation on Cezanne, line manager evaluation on Cezanne, and performance review meeting with the line manager.
To learn more about theses processes, see the Mathison documentation on [Appraisal](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Interact/Pages/Section/ContentListing.aspx?subsection=3715) and [Performance Review](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/page/2319).

It is recommended to use the [SMART goals framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria).
Please note that this may not be the exact same list as your own professional goals, which may
come up in discussion with your line manager as well, but is simply used to assess your work
against programme and Institute level goals.

The May appraisal cycle is also an opportunity to review and set personal development goals, but these should be in scope for conversations with your line manager throughout the year.

### Example RAM Objectives for Appraisal

1. Expand Turing research impact with 2-3 industry or government stakeholders
- Further develop working relationship with stakeholder groups by organising 1-2 stakeholder workshops
- Identify 1-2 new opportunities to collaborate with potential Turing partners
2. Expand impact of RAM team within and beyond the Turing
- Contribute 1-2 new tools to RAM repository of reusable templates and open infrastructure tools
- Give 1-2 external presentations on the RAM team
3. Contribute to open & responsible AI work and thought leadership
- Organise 1-2 events on open source AI which highlight Turing additionality and convene a diverse audience
- Write 1 paper to present at conference featuring work at The Turing
