# People & teams onboarding session

This file contains the information to cover in the people & teams onboarding session for a new RAM member!
This session should probably be one of the first sessions the new team member does

Time required: 1 hour

## Line manager checklist
- [ ] Introduce new starter in the TPS-team Slack channel
- [ ] Find a TPS Team coffee chat in the week they are starting that a majority of the team can make to say hi - ideally this would be on their first day but could be a different day if needed!
- [ ] Ensure someone from the project teams they'll be joining is set-up to onboard them to the project, and will help them meet everyone on the team
- [ ] Make a list of people for new starter to meet & set up coffee chats with in the first few weeks
